# IceFishing-Game

Our implementation of the Arduino Micro Arcade

Our reach for this game is the Ice Fishing game on club penguin. 

Instructions:

The objective of the "Ice Fishing" game is to catch as many fishes as you can using the potentiometer, which controls the fishing rod. Once the player gets a score of 100, they win the game. Every time the player catches 10 fishes, the total amount of points is displayed, and the player moves on to another level. The moment a fish is caught, it will vertically align with the bait and become dim, indicating that the player has caught a fish! As the levels progress, the fish and jellyfish start moving faster,increasing the difficulty of the game. In addition, after the player gets 30 points, a second jelly fish appears on the screen. The player only has 3 baits and each time the the fishing rod (including the bait) touches a jellyfish, they lose a bait(it's okay if a caught fish touches a jellyfish though!). Once the player loses all 3 baits, "Game Over" will flash on the screen and the player can click the blue button to reset the game.
